This project was initially based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9g-Zhsd_FE) by Raul Terhes in order to get familiar with Redux-Toolkit and React. I decided to forgo the use of Redux Saga as i felt it overcomplicated things and also added TypeScript.
I added additional functionality, in the form of difficulty, number of question selection, etc. and saving app-state to localstorage.

Eventually, i've turned this project into a sort of playground, converting it from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), checking redux middleware functionality and adding a various bits of knowledge i've accrued over-time.
